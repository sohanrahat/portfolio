            Hey there! I am a junior front-end web developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, specializing in building robust and user-friendly web applications.

            My background as a photographer and filmmaker equips me with a keen eye for design, visual storytelling, and user experienceâ€”unique strengths I bring to front-end development.

            Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I combine creative thinking with technical problem-solving and am ready to contribute to a forward-thinking team.
